The plugin converts the dump local files to a ParaView readable format.
In the liggghts input script you must use the following command

compute bc all property/local batom1x batom1y batom1z batom2x batom2y batom2z batom1 batom2 btype bforceX bforceY bforceZ btorqueX btorqueY btorqueZ beqdist

where
batom1x, batom1y, batom1z is the position of the first atom of the bond pair
batom2x, batom2y, batom2z is the position of the second atom of the bond pair
batom1, batom2, and btype is the ids of each atom and the type of the bond
bforceX, bforceY, and bforceZ are the forces in each bond
btorqueX, btorqueY, and btorqueZ are the torques in each bond
and beqdist is the equilibrium distance between the two atoms

You then would need to use the following dump command

dump bondforcechain all local ${fileprint_step} post/bfc*.bond &
    c_bc[1] c_bc[2] c_bc[3] c_bc[4] c_bc[5] c_bc[6] c_bc[7] c_bc[8] c_bc[9] c_bc[10] c_bc[11] c_bc[12] c_bc[13] c_bc[14] c_bc[15] c_bc[16]

to generate the dump files

The Plugin outputs a VTKPolyData Object which contains the Points and a line connecting each bond-pair for visualization
